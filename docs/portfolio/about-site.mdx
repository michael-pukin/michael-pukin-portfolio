# About My Portfolio Site

This website was constructed with Docusaurus, a static site generator created by Meta. Each section is created using Markdown files in the back end. 

I chose Docusaurus for this site because of its flexibility and ease of customization. When I worked for a previous employer, I used Docusaurus as part of a Docs as Code workflow that I implemented.
