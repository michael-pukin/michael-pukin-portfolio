# About My Portfolio Site

This website was constructed with Docusaurus, a static site generator created by Meta. Each page is based on a file authored in Markdown on the back end. 

I chose Docusaurus for this site because of its flexibility and ease of customization. When I worked for a previous employer, I used Docusaurus as part of a Docs as Code workflow that I implemented.

Similar to a Docs as Code methodology, the site code is also tied to source control via Git. To  browse the source files that make up the site, visit [my public GitHub page](https://github.com/michael-pukin/michael-pukin-portfolio).
