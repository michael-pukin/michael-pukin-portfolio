# Sample Changes/Release Notes - Integration Guide


import PDFEmbed from '@site/src/components/PDFEmbed';

This is a sample of a change log I wrote for an API integration guide. It functions as a hybrid of product release notes and a list of changes to the documentation, as the documentation was frequently updated when new product features were released.
